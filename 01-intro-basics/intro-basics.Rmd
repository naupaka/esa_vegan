## Workshop logistics

* Etherpad [[link here]]
* Red and Green Stickies

## Packages installed?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("vegan", dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages("plyr")
install.packages("reshape2")
```

## Introduction to **vegan**

* What is it?
* Who developed it?
* How does it differ from other alternatives?

We've all heard data horror stories

## Cleaning your data for import into R for use in vegan

* Spreadsheet example

## Cleaning your data for import into R for use in vegan

* We will use built-in datasets for species `varespec` and environmental variables `varechem`
    * from: Väre, H., Ohtonen, R. and Oksanen, J. (1995)

```{r, results='hide'}
library("vegan")
data(varespec)
data(varechem)
```

```{r}
head(varespec[,1:8], n = 3)
```

## Summarizing data with `apply()`

Sum of rows
```{r}
sum.of.rows <- apply(varespec, 1, sum)
```
Sum of columns
```{r}
sum.of.columns <- apply(varespec, 2, sum)
```


## Data transformation with `decostand()`

* total
* max
* pa
* hellinger
* `wisconsin()`
    * this is the same as first standardizing species by `max` and sites by `total`
* Etc

## Types of distance metrics | and why you might want to use one instead of another

* Presence/absence
* Abundance based
* Probabilistic

## Calculating community distances with `vegdist()` | so many distance metrics, so little time!

Examples: 

* Bray
* Jaccard
* Morisita
* How to choose a good one for your data set?
    * `rankindex()`

## Rarefaction

## Within vs between group similarities

* `betadisper()`
